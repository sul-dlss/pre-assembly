project_name:      'Foo'                   # Required.  If objects are not yet registered, this will be used as a prefix to the sourceID and will also become a project tag in DOR for each object.

project_style:

  # Defines the default structure of content metadata.  Set content_md_creation[:style] below if you want to bundle files into resources.

                     'book_with_pdf' # Like simple_book, but any resource nodes with any file other than an image (e.g. a PDF) will have <resource type="file">

                     'book_as_image' # Like simple_book, but with <contentMetadata type="book"> and <resource type="image"> instead of "page".
