# General options relating to project type and the registration of objects.  For each option, you must select only one value
# from the options shown.
####

project_style:

  # Defines the default structure of content metadata.  Set content_md_creation[:style] below if you want to bundle files into resources.
  # The 'Process : Content Type' tag for each existing object will be examined.  If a known type is set in this tag,
  # it will be used instead of the default below.
  content_structure: 'simple_image'  # Every file in the digital object will appear as a <file> node with <contentMetadata type="image"> and <resource type="image">

                     'file'          # Like simple_image, but with <contentMetadata type="file"> and <resource type="file">.

                     'simple_book'   # Like simple_image, but with <contentMetadata type="book"> and <resource type="page">.

                     'book_with_pdf' # Like simple_book, but any resource nodes with any file other than an image (e.g. a PDF) will have <resource type="file">

                     'book_as_image' # Like simple_book, but with <contentMetadata type="book"> and <resource type="image"> instead of "page".

                     'smpl'          # Used for SMPL projects

  content_tag_override:   false      # DEFAULT if not supplied -- content_structure as defined above is always used even if the object is registered with a content type tag
                          true       # if set to true; then content_structure type is deteremined from registered object content type tag using mappings defined in pre-assembly if possible;
                                     # if no content tag is available or an unknown mapping occurs, the default content_structure defined in the YAML is used
####
# Paths to the pre-assembly input and output.
####

bundle_dir:  '/foo/bar/revs'  # Input location for the project content (i.e., the
                             # "bundle"). May contain images directly or may contain
                             # folders, one per object, usually named by druid.
                             # A fully qualified path.

staging_style:    'copy'     # the staging style, can be "copy" or "symlink", defaults to "copy" if not specified or nil
                             #  if set to "copy" then all discovered files that need to be staged will be copied from the bundle directory to the staging directory
                             #  if set to "symlink", then all discovered files will be symlinked into the staging directory from the bundle directory
####
# Once object containers have been identified, specify which files within those
# containers should be staged (i.e., copied to the assembly_staging_dir).
####

stageable_discovery:

  # Option 1: If you set 'use_container' to true, this will simply stage the entire object directory that was matched with the glob above.
  use_container: true    # If true , set glob and regex to nil below.
                 false   # If false, use glob and regex below.

  # Option 2: If you set 'use_container' to false, staging will be done via a two-phase container crawl based on the glob and regex patterns specified below.
  #
  # The glob parameter can be used to flatten or partially flatten the input
  # directory structure. For example, consider this input structure:
  #
  #   aa111bb2222/
  #     00/
  #       1.tif
  #       2.tif
  #       1.jp2
  #       2.jp2
  #
  # If glob = '*', both the 00 and 01 subdirectories will be staged in
  # their entirely, preserving the original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00', only the 00 subdirectory will be staged, preserving
  # its original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00/*', only the files within 00 will be staged, which means
  # that the 00 subdirectory will not appear in the staged materials, as
  # shown here:
  #
  #    aa/111/bb/2222/
  #      1.tif
  #      2.tif
  #
  # As above, express the glob and regex in relative terms -- in
  # this case, relative to the container.
  #
  #  Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression).
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  '0[12]/'  # Stage the 00, 01, and 02 subdirectories.
         '00/*'    # Stage the items in the 00 subdirectory only, but not the '00' folder itself.
         '*/*'     # Stage the items residing at the second level in the structure.
         '**/*'    # Stage all leaf items. Results it total flattening. Use with caution since it may cause file name clashes.  Note-this will also stage all folders
                   #   as well, unless you further restrict to specific files only using the regex below.
         '*'       # Stage all items at the root level of the container (useful for a container that has no structure, just a list of files)

  regex:  ~                       # No filtering.
         '(?ix) \. (tif|xml) $'  # Stage only items with .tif and .xml extentions.
  files_only:  true     # if set to true, then only files will be staged, regardless of glob specified above (i.e. any folders that match the glob will
                        #  be ignored) -- this is useful to avoid duplication of staged files
                        #  if set to false or left off, then anything that matches the glob (and not filtered by regex) will be staged

####
# Additional materials accompaning the bundle.
#
# These file names below should be expressed in relative terms -- relative to bundle_dir.
####

manifest:         'manifest.csv'       # The manifest file, if 'use_manifest' is true.  Path must be relative to the bundle path. Otherwise, set to ~
checksums_file:   'checksums.txt'      # A provider checksum file (in default md5sum format).  Path must be relative to the bundle path. If none provided, set to ~
desc_md_template: 'mods_template.xml'  # An optional descriptive metadata XML template to use in conjunction with the manifest.  Path can be absolute or relative to the bundle path.

####
# You must indicate the column names of certain fields in the CSV file.
# These should always be lowercase.  Note that if your project is using a manifest for object discovery and has objects already registered, you will
# need a column called "druid" in addition to the columns below.  The "source_id" and "label" columns must exist in this case but can be blank (since objects are already registered).
manifest_cols:
  object_container:   'filename'   # Always required, indicates the column name containing the filename (single file per object) or folder name (multiple files per object) relative to the bundle directory.
  source_id:          'sourceid'   # optional
  label:              'label'      # optional

# Attributes related to content metadata generation.

# A regex to exclude staged files from contentMetadata.xml (content will still be staged though).
content_exclusion: ~             # Include all staged files in content metadata.
                   '(?i)\.xml$'  # Exclude xml files from content metadata.

# The method used to bundle resources together when generating content metadata.
content_md_creation:
  style:       'default'                # Used by most projects, creates one resource per file.
               'filename'                 # Collects files together into a single resource based on filename -- files with the same name but different extensions will become
                                          # part of a single resource node.
               'dpg'                 # Collects files together into a single resource based on DPG filenaming convention (ignoring _00_,_05_, etc.) -- files with the same name but different extensions will become
                                         # part of a single resource node.
               'smpl'                   # Only used by SMPL projects.  Will generate a content metadata file using the SMPL preContentMetadata.
               'none'                   # Do not generate any contentMetadata.xml file.  Select this option only if you have a previously created valid contentMetadata.xml in the root of your staged folder.
  smpl_manifest:    'smpl_manifest.csv'  # The manifest file for use in SMPL projects.  Typically set to ~ unless style='smpl'

publish_attr:  ~  # Most projects should set this to nil.  If not specified or nil, they will be added by the assembly robots based on mimetype.

  # If you want to specify them here, you can do it in two ways.  First off, don't set 'publish_attr' to nil.  Next
  # set it globally for all files, like this:
  shelve:   'no'
  publish:  'no'
  preserve: 'yes'

  # The second is by mime-type, nesting under each mimetype (which must be quoted), like this.  The attributes will be set according to the
  #  mime-type of the file.  You must also set a 'default', which will be applied if no mime-type matches.  If any of the default attributes are
  # set to nil and no mime-type matches, the attributes will be left off and added during assembly according to the defaults.
