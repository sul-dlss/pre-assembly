00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:38.654
(upbeat music)

2
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.470
<v ->Well, I guess first I want to say</v>

3
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.870
that every student is special.

4
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.720
And I want to get that out first before saying,

5
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.929
but some students are more special than others.

6
00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.690 line:15% 
(audience laughs)

7
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.240 line:15% 
When I first heard about Angela,

8
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.900 line:15% 
it was during her undergraduate years,

9
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.520
and that's unusual to begin with,

10
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.680
when you hear about a student who's not even,

11
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.140
hadn't even applied to graduate school yet.

12
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.690
But I did know about a student

13
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.400
who was working on the Black Panther Party

14
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.566
and was doing very interesting work.

15
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:57.260
And I knew immediately that there would be a real scramble

16
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.985
for somebody who is outstanding

17
00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:05.060
and they graduated with honors from Harvard

18
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.285
and wanting to go on graduate school.

19
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:09.270
And it just seemed

20
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.480
that here was someone who was not only a great student

21
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.810
but someone who seemed to have a real vision.

22
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.820
And I think that's what made her very special,

23
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.700
someone who had a notion

24
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.910
about where to apply her talents

25
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.040
to make a real contribution that was unique

26
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.790
and distinctive and important.

27
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.470
And that was certainly the case with Angela.

28
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.612
When she was working on a thesis

29
00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:37.495
on the women in the Black Panther Party,

30
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:41.700
a subject that had not really received a great deal

31
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.370
of attention and one that required a great deal

32
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.740
of originality that you can do the research.

33
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.340
You had to go out and find the people,

34
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.340
and a lot of them were spread throughout the country.

35
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.683
But clearly Angela was able to do that.

36
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.170
Once it clear that Stanford was among the places

37
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.100
that she was considering for graduate school,

38
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.300
I think I would have offered just about anything

39
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.100
to Stanford to offer to get her to come here.

40
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100
But I think probably the most important thing

41
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.120
we offered was the possibility

42
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.290
of bringing the Black Panther papers here to Stanford,

43
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.540
which was being discussed at that time.

44
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.930
And to me, this has been a really perfect fit

45
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.930
of having a person who is, I think, the worldwide expert

46
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:34.055
on the Black Panther Party, even as a graduate student

47
00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:38.720
and having the most important collection here at Stanford.

48
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.250
And I think that Angela has not only taken advantage

49
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.018
of this possibility but really made the most of it

50
00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:51.018
now as director of the Black Panther Research Project,

51
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.830
which has been established on this campus

52
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.900
and has already become the center for research

53
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.810
on the Black Panther Party and her forthcoming thesis,

54
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.680
which I hope will quickly be turned into a book

55
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.680
on the subject, I think will reshape

56
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.560
what people think about the Panthers.

57
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.910
Although there is a lot of people know something

58
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.370
about the Black Panther Party through its notoriety,

59
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.980
there's been actually very little

60
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.490
significant scholarly research,

61
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.670
and no scholarly book has been written

62
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.453
on the Black Panther Party to date.

63
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.490
So this is an area that I think we need a great deal

64
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.960
of research and I can't think of anyone more qualified

65
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.460
to do it than Angela.

66
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.877
So here is Angela.
(audience applauds)

67
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.853
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

68
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.040
I don't know what my talk is going to sound like

69
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.040
after that introduction, (laughs) but I'll do my best.

70
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.700 line:15% 
First I want to say good afternoon to everyone here,

71
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.290 line:15% 
and I'm so pleased that so many of you came out

72
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.143 line:15% 
during lunchtime to essentially hear a history lecture.

73
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.120
What's really interesting though

74
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.060
is that as Professor Carson said,

75
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.830
I don't just think of what I do as history.

76
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.690
I also try to find the lessons that can be learned

77
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.670
from the research that I do to apply to life today.

78
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.360
And with that in mind,

79
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.810
I'd like to ask you to not just hear the information,

80
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.440
the dates and the details,

81
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.860
but think about the issues and the concepts

82
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.316
that surround some of the material

83
00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:44.220
that I talk about and really see how it applies

84
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.140
to your life that you've lived in the past, now,

85
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.540
younger people you might know,

86
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.800
older people you might know,

87
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.800
just move outside of your box that we're normally in

88
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.343
when we think about material that is new and different.

89
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.310
Before I begin my official talk,

90
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.193
I'd like to ask for a little audience participation.

91
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.810
What I'd like to know personally is what came to mind,

92
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.709
and I just need three or four bold volunteers

93
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.570
to let me know what came to mind

94
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.340
when they read the title of my talk,

95
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.397
and the title is "From Babies for the Revolution

96
00:06:28.397 --> 00:06:30.947
"to Planned Parenthood: The Transformation

97
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:32.247
"of the Black Panther Party

98
00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:36.340
"Female Revolutionary 1966 to 1982."

99
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.640
So what's the first thing you thought?

100
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.940
What'd you expect to hear?

101
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.530
Yes.

102
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.363
<v Audience Member>I thought I really wanted to hear it,</v>

103
00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:44.367
because I've always wondered what happened to the women

104
00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:46.043
of the Black Panther Party.

105
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.900
I wonder if they got buried as much as most women

106
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.958
of revolutionary parties.

107
00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.083
<v ->Okay.</v>

108
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.410
<v Audience Member>I thought of Ericka Huggins</v>

109
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.307
and Elaine Brown, wanted to know about them.

110
00:06:58.307 --> 00:06:59.370
Because those were the women

111
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.656
that I was aware of in the '60s.

112
00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:02.971
<v ->Okay.</v>

113
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:03.804
Yes.

114
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:05.250
<v ->Actually, I thought of Angela Davis</v>

115
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.030
and how she's gone from being a fugitive

116
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.890
to a respected professor and author,

117
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.290
and I wondered what happened to the other women.

118
00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:16.910
Because you only hear, I only hear about her

119
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.637
and I don't care about the others.

120
00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:20.497
<v ->Right, okay.</v>

121
00:07:20.497 --> 00:07:22.020
One more.

122
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.480
<v ->I thought of Burmese and labor production.</v>

123
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.430
<v ->Very interesting.</v>

124
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.494
Okay.

125
00:07:28.494 --> 00:07:29.327
Well,

126
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.330
I've written a couple other articles

127
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.034
that deal specifically and in more detail

128
00:07:38.034 --> 00:07:41.410
with all of those issues.

129
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.410
And today's talk won't be exactly

130
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.630
what at least the people who expressed are expecting

131
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.210
or thought when they immediately saw the title

132
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.340
of the topic.

133
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.930
But again, as I said, with the information,

134
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.104
you'll be able to have a larger idea

135
00:08:02.104 --> 00:08:04.940
of what exactly was going on

136
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.863
during a particular point in time on a particular topic.

137
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.260
I'd like everyone to bear in mind what they just heard,

138
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.820
think about each of your own ideas,

139
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.590
and open your mind to information I'm about to present.

140
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.380
I'll spend about 30 minutes or so talking specifically

141
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.150
about Black Panther Party women and their transformation.

142
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.770
In between, I'll include about a five-minute clip,

143
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.680
a video clip of a former female Black Panther Party member,

144
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.810
Ericka Huggins actually, who's reflecting

145
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.780
on some of her experiences in the organization

146
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.580
as it relates to reproduction

147
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.580
and gender roles and differences in national chapters.

148
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.670
And then finally,

149
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.860
I'll spend the remaining time answering questions,

150
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.310
any questions you might have.

151
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.640
The primary intent of my discussion

152
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.260
is to trace the transformation

153
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.910
of Black Panther Party women

154
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.370
through three phases that I've identified to date.

155
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.370
The first I identify as woman as vessel, woman as nurturer,

156
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.840
covering the years between 1968 and 1970.

157
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.750
At this point, Black Panther Party women were seen

158
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.000
as a conduit for the continuation of the race.

159
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.990
Additionally, they were supporters and nurturers

160
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.670
for the male members that saw them as objects.

161
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.917
There were large numbers of Black Panther Party deaths.

162
00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:41.115
Anti and voluntary sterilization sentiment was rampant

163
00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:44.780
among party members,

164
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.823
and the members were primarily under the age of 20 years.

165
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.560
The second stage I call the transitional woman,

166
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.560
dynamic woman phase between 1971 and 1977.

167
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.590
The concept of the revolutionary Black woman is

168
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.190
in serious flux regarding the woman's primary roles

169
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.430
as nurturers and supporters.

170
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.710
Organizationally, there's less funding

171
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.840
to support the additional children

172
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.423
that need to be fed and cared for.

173
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.350
In 1971, a serious round of party centralization takes place

174
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.400
causing a high concentration

175
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.760
of highly effective female organizers to concentrate

176
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.380
in one area, that being Oakland, California.

177
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.690
During the later years of this phase,

178
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.920
finances improved slightly.

179
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.080
The women become more mature due to natural age increase

180
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.470
and planned parenthood begun in earnest

181
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.700
during 1972 reaches fruition.

182
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.700
The final phase, which includes the years 1977 to 1982

183
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:52.880
are slightly more difficult to describe.

184
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.370
Perhaps the woman as organizer,

185
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.060
woman as asexual being best describes this phase

186
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.420
of Black Panther Party history.

187
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.530
This phase is characterized by the height

188
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.430
of female leadership and organizing

189
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.970
and simultaneously by women's renewed discussion

190
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.970
of the restrictive dating policy applied to women

191
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.470
and letters suggesting, letters from these female members

192
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.190
to Huey Newton, the organization's leader,

193
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.930
suggesting a painful feeling of isolation

194
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.240
and lack of sex appeal

195
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.893
to non-Black Panther Party community members.

196
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.050
My concern today follows the yearlong theme,

197
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.820
public policy, private lives.

198
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.730
Instead of focusing on national

199
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.700
or local legislation that might have had an impact

200
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.040
on women in the Black Panther Party,

201
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.030
I decided to focus on the intraorganizational policies

202
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.060
that had an impact on the private lives of these women.

203
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.950
Some of the policies were known

204
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.520
to the surrounding communities

205
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.620
within which these activists organized, others were not.

206
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.200
Nevertheless, all decisions made had a direct

207
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.163
or indirect effect on the female leadership.

208
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.840
I'm sorry, female membership,

209
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.770
which would include the leadership as well

210
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.713
as the rank and file.

211
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.810
With the exception of people

212
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.780
from the San Francisco Bay Area,

213
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.600
many people have no idea what the Black Panther Party was.

214
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.430
The Black Panther Party was an organization composed

215
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.430
of a contingent of lower and middle class African Americans

216
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.720
that sent waves throughout the world

217
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.220
initially with their call

218
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.010
for armed self-defense against police harassment.

219
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.970
The BPP was co-founded on October 15, 1966

220
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.070
by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California,

221
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.490
in the West Oakland Poverty Center office.

222
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.453
That office doubled as Seale's place of employment.

223
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.077
On that day, the co-founders drafted a document

224
00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:57.870
they named the Ten-Point Platform and Program.

225
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.980
This charter called for freedom and land,

226
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.050
improved housing, economics, education

227
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.800
and police relations, as well as a UN-supervised plebiscite

228
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.260
for African Americans to convene

229
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and determine the parameter of their national destiny.

230
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.360
By 1970, the Black Panther Party had expanded

231
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.370
to greater than 40 chapters

232
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.120
and branches locally, nationally, and worldwide.

233
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.460
Although no official records exist,

234
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.360
several former high ranking leaders have stated

235
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.060
that at its height

236
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.320
the Black Panther Party had thousands of members.

237
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.310
While the BPP was intended

238
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.600
as an all-male organization from its creation,

239
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.860
within two years, females represented approximately 60%

240
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.020
of the party's membership.

241
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.300
Between 1968 and 1982,

242
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.080
the Black Panther Party developed greater

243
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.480
than 50 community programs,

244
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.630
the majority of which were coordinated

245
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.763
and staffed by female members.

246
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.640
The years between 1974 and 1977 were the most crucial

247
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.860
for women programmatically.

248
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.910
With women at the organization's helm

249
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.500
during these years, the Black Panther Party

250
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.270
implemented its largest number

251
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.820
of new community programs, approximately 30,

252
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.339
and became intimately involved in local electoral politics.

253
00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:29.280
Furthermore, at any given moment after 1968

254
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.010
when the organization expanded its focus

255
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.390
to include community organizing,

256
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.860
females continued to represent the majority

257
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.490
of the membership.

258
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.400
Therefore, it is crucial to understand the variety

259
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.310
of roles they performed between 1966 and 1982,

260
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.630
because they represented the largest percentage

261
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.180
of the membership.

262
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.530
While they were not always the decision-makers

263
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.050
to an extent that reflected their numbers,

264
00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.110
they were influential in many decisions that were made.

265
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.220
Additionally, they received the greatest fallout

266
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.130
from many of those same group policies.

267
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.800
Before we can understand the Black Panther Party

268
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.120
women's experiences, we must account for the fact

269
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.890
that Black Panther Party women were not a monolithic group

270
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.140
with monolithic experiences.

271
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.915
They were divided or united by regional upbringing,

272
00:15:21.915 --> 00:15:25.950 line:15% 
economic background, differing educational levels

273
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.523 line:15% 
and diverging ages to name only a few categories.

274
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.660
During the earliest years of the Black Panther Party,

275
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.750
during the earliest years,

276
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.750
the Black Panther Party was a nationalist organization

277
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.400
with race as a primary category for organizing.

278
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.490
The unique aspect of their group, however,

279
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.230
was their eventual willingness

280
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.070
to incorporate an economic component into their analysis

281
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.940
to compliment the traditional race-based approach.

282
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.580
When you combine these components with the fact

283
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.500
that during 1968 and 1969 local

284
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.800
and federal law enforcement attacked the group most

285
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.290
with at least 30 members dying during 1969,

286
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.530
it becomes clear why both male

287
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.770
and female party members would begin to call for replacement

288
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.233
of the dying members.

289
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.290
And the myths of constant raids by police,

290
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.250
FBI telephone and visual surveillance

291
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.210
and the tenor of the times

292
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.490
that a revolution was just around the corner,

293
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.050
the Black Panther Party members, the majority

294
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.380
of whom were younger than 20 years decided to birth babies

295
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.400
for the revolution to ensure that the struggle will continue

296
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.150
in the event that they were killed.

297
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.540
This was never an official policy

298
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.370
in the sense that there's no evidence

299
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.120
of a directive to the various chapters.

300
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.830
However, personal letters and articles were published

301
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.870
in the Black Panther Party newspaper

302
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.870
that by 1969 had an international distribution.

303
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.980
According to Black Panther Party member Deborah Johnson,

304
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.541
the fiancee of Fred Hampton,

305
00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:11.541
the recently assassinated 1969 and renowned chairman

306
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.910
of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party,

307
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.880
the role of the revolutionary Black woman was

308
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.930
to reproduce Black revolutionaries

309
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.460
to challenge the inequalities of the social system.

310
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.580
Similarly, another female Panther argued

311
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.720
that once a Black woman has reached a certain level

312
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.560
of awareness of the needs

313
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.657
of her family and of her children, quote,

314
00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:40.237
"She then becomes an artist existing solely

315
00:17:40.237 --> 00:17:43.017
"for the the purpose of helping the Black man

316
00:17:43.017 --> 00:17:45.307
"achieve the heights of his ambition."

317
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.850
The art in the Black Panther community

318
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.520
news service newspaper also reflected the concept

319
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.450
of the revolutionary Black family.

320
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.513
The fact that these items were published

321
00:17:57.513 --> 00:18:00.700
with no articles to rebut the concept

322
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.530
suggested to the public at least

323
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.163
that this was an official organizational policy.

324
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.920
An example of the belief

325
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.850
that woman was a vessel is an analysis

326
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.690
of Bobby Seale's discussion of the way the party used women

327
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.490
as organizing tools in the early years

328
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.553
and also a phrase Eldridge Cleaver referred to

329
00:18:24.553 --> 00:18:27.180
during his campaign for president

330
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.053
on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket in 1968.

331
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.883
The phrase he used was pussy power.

332
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.180
In both leaders' minds,

333
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.680
women could be used strategically to attract men

334
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.203
to the party who probably would not join on their own.

335
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.193
Physical attraction would be the primary bait.

336
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.910
While Bobby Seale wrote about it

337
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.117
in his first party publication called "Seize the Time:

338
00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:59.600
"The Story of Huey Newton and the Black Panther Party"

339
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.300
published during '69, Eldridge Cleaver publicly spoke

340
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.810
about this concept wherever he went

341
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.383
during his 1968 campaign.

342
00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.890
While not all women,

343
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.060
all Black Panther Party women agreed with this policy,

344
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.820
there is no evidence

345
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.893
that anyone told him to stop using the concept publicly.

346
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.660
It is important to note here

347
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.600
that not all women agreed with

348
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.990
or adhered to unofficial party policies.

349
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.700
Older females and those with strong personalities

350
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.476
resisted any attempts to categorize them

351
00:19:34.476 --> 00:19:36.560
and force them to do things

352
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.670
with which they did not agree.

353
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.960
For example, Elaine Brown, the only woman

354
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.100
in the party to rise to the highest organizational position

355
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.610
as chairman recalled that she always had used birth control

356
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.460
despite what any unofficial

357
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.523
or official organizational policies had been.

358
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.434
Health reports for other members

359
00:19:57.434 --> 00:20:00.100
that I've located in the collection

360
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.640
in the Huey P. Newton papers supports this

361
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.874
with references to women's choices to have abortions,

362
00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:12.010
intrauterine devices, IUDs,

363
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.670
and to use birth control pills as options.

364
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.790
And at this point I'd like to stop and let you listen

365
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.180
to Ericka Huggins, who begins by talking

366
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.610
about her husband, her former husband, John Huggins,

367
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.610
who had been killed in 1969 during an altercation

368
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.660
at UCLA between the Panthers and US members.

369
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.790
So that's where she begins.

370
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.110
But then she'll discuss a specific experience

371
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.450
that she had when she traveled from the Los Angeles chapter

372
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.803
where she originally joined in '68 to the Bay Area chapter.

373
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.213
<v ->When I first, let's see in 1960,</v>

374
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.900
well, John was killed on January 17th of 1969

375
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.160
here on UCLA's campus.

376
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.793
John Huggins was one amazing man.

377
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.090
And I don't say that because I'm biased.

378
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.600
He was my friend before he was my lover,

379
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.150
and he remains to be my friend.

380
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.106
He was a man who took a bath with rubber duckies.

381
00:21:23.106 --> 00:21:24.050
(audience laughs)

382
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.970
See, we don't like to admit how we really live, okay.

383
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.730
We like to act like we all are on some pedestals

384
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.880
and that nothing we do stinks, and we don't cry,

385
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.970
and we don't get scared

386
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.620
in the middle of the night, and we do.

387
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.400
He took a bath with rubber duckies

388
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.130
and he loved his daughter who he only knew for three weeks.

389
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.730
And he told me something once.

390
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.527
He said, "It is impossible to make revolution in society

391
00:21:49.527 --> 00:21:53.078
"if you don't make first revolution in yourself."

392
00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.870
<v Audience Member>True, it's true.</v>

393
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:55.850
<v ->He told me that.</v>

394
00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.450
I was 19 years old and pregnant with our daughter

395
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.830
and I have never forgotten it.

396
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.050
And it stays with me.

397
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:07.730
And it is the, it is the jumping off place inside myself

398
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.800
that I do my own inner work.

399
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.510
I wanted to say that

400
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.790
when I was pregnant with Mai, she'll be 26 in December,

401
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.490
when I was pregnant with Mai,

402
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.590
I walked into a party house and we had all these houses

403
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.120
where we lived collectively,

404
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.173
men, women, children, everybody.

405
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.480
And this was in Oakland right around the corner

406
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.140
from the national headquarters office,

407
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.100
which you'll see in one of these pictures over here

408
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.993
on the wall.

409
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.810
And we were eating dinner.

410
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.980
Well, the women,

411
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.330
and see, this was not a role we allowed ourselves

412
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.260
to be relegated to.

413
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.390
The women had cooked the dinner, which was very sweet.

414
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.500
I didn't think very much of it.

415
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.650
Elaine and I were standing there together.

416
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.830
And the men were sitting in the front room,

417
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.210
and we thought that was a little odd,

418
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.010
because in Los Angeles,

419
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.130
everybody cooked everything and everybody ate.

420
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.140
And then I walked toward the kitchen

421
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.180
with my belly, like, way big.

422
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.603
I walked toward the kitchen to get food for us.

423
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.760
And someone said to me, "Sister,

424
00:23:21.257 --> 00:23:23.757
"you gonna have to wait 'cause the men eat first."

425
00:23:24.658 --> 00:23:27.800
(audience laughs)

426
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.883
I couldn't believe I was hearing this.

427
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.390
And then I heard conversation

428
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.220
about we make the next warriors for the revolution.

429
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.461
No we don't.

430
00:23:37.461 --> 00:23:40.084
(audience laughs)

431
00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:43.950
I'm saying that that doesn't come from the party.

432
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.460
That was not something that Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,

433
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.280
or David Hilliard ever put out as a way

434
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.510
in which we would behave or believe.

435
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:56.287
That came as a response to virulent oppression

436
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.870
and trying to reclaim something of Africa

437
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.060
and trying to have a culture that wasn't one of slavery.

438
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.853
However, it didn't work,

439
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.900
because my baby and I were going to eat first and we did.

440
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.770
And the men in that house were very angry

441
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.370
with Elaine and I for stepping out of our place.

442
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.140
And we continued to do that,

443
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.320
and we continue to still step out of our place.

444
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.320
And we're saying that as Maya Angelou the other night said

445
00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.950
her grand-aunt said to her once,

446
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.050
she said to her sister, "You got to stand out on the word."

447
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.860
Well, we all need to be stand-up people

448
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.240
just like I was that day.

449
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.979
I didn't do that because I had some political

450
00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:48.120
blah, blah, blah, blah.

451
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.243
I was hungry,

452
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.920
and the baby was hungry, and it made no sense.

453
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.970
So I'm giving you anecdotes to let you know,

454
00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.680
there are these anecdotes are the answers

455
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.440
to all those wonderful questions that Ron mentioned.

456
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.830
What we need to do is go forward

457
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.020
with love and compassion for our people

458
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.330
and for ourselves.

459
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.130
We don't know how to love ourselves.

460
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.050
I could tell you story after story, Huey Newton's addiction,

461
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.630
yes, he was a dope fiend.

462
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.500
Huey Newton's addiction was the result

463
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.961
of the constant onslaught from society

464
00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:31.143
and the constant onslaught from inside.

465
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.500
And we all have our demons to fight.

466
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.630
If we're going to do anything to change society,

467
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.630
we have to fight those demons, meet them face on.

468
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.610
And if we don't, we're not going to change any society.

469
00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.060
We're not going to fight police brutality.

470
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.580
We're not going to do anything

471
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.561
except be at odds with ourselves.

472
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.394
<v Audience Member>That's right.</v>

473
00:25:55.394 --> 00:25:57.663
<v ->So that's all I want to say to you right now.</v>

474
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.583
<v ->So as Ericka Huggins said,</v>

475
00:26:02.583 --> 00:26:06.140
there was no official policy

476
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.317 line:15% 
that there had to be babies for the revolution

477
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:11.600 line:15% 
and that there had to be women

478
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.350 line:15% 
who cooked the dinner all the time

479
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.400 line:15% 
and ate after the men ate.

480
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.280
But nevertheless, these things did go on

481
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.293
at local chapter levels.

482
00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:28.156
The babies for the revolution concept was popular

483
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.000
during 1969 and 1970.

484
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.713
But the overall lifetime for these ideas was short-lived.

485
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.690
While the policy might've been lauded at the time

486
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.400
as a logical approach to solve the immediate urgency

487
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.000
of replacing the fallen comrades,

488
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.540
the long-term impact of such action

489
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.363
soon had to be confronted.

490
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.960
In addition to the party's loss of individuals,

491
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.580
there were also massive arrests during these early years.

492
00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.860
This meant that the BPP's coffers were constantly strained

493
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.920
because of the need to pay bail,

494
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.740
particularly for those organizers

495
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.530
who were considered crucial to the group's fundraising

496
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.420
and community organizing potential.

497
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.850
Consequently, the lack of funds

498
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.930
in addition to the lack of childcare facilities

499
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.850
meant that women were caught in a precarious position.

500
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.620
Most people who joined the party survived

501
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.960
using the proceeds generated from newspaper sales

502
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.030
among other things, such as donations that were solicited

503
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.590
from businesses and private arenas.

504
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:40.060
However, during pregnancy and after female had the baby,

505
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.540
she was physically unable to provide for herself

506
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.220
using the same strategies.

507
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.230
Also Panthers nationwide continued to live

508
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.950
in collective housing to minimize expenses.

509
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.270
With the new mothers now out of commission

510
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.340
and unable to provide for themselves

511
00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.810
and others in the house,

512
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.300
the organizational strain

513
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.160
at the immediate local level was clear.

514
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.180
The absence of childcare and funds led some women

515
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.380
to make decisions that they probably would not have made.

516
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.660
Numerous women left the organization

517
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.030
to take care of their children.

518
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.082
Deborah Johnson, the same woman

519
00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:20.960
who had advocated replacing fallen Black Panther Party men

520
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.360
with new warriors left the party within one year

521
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.290
after her son's birth.

522
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.960
Johnson had attempted to maintain the same level

523
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.130
of party work after childbirth

524
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.100
by asking her mother to care for her infant son.

525
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.570
Shortly, however, she joined her son,

526
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.990
because she could not fathom the idea of her mother caring

527
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.340
for her child as the sole caregiver.

528
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.260
In her mind, it was her responsibility,

529
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.183
and she wanted to have more contact with her child.

530
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.956
Black Panther Party mothers during these earliest years

531
00:28:53.956 --> 00:28:57.240
had realized that emphasis on motherhood

532
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.010
without the proper support structures in place

533
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.490
often meant de-emphasis of their roles

534
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.200
as effective community organizers.

535
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.850
During 1969 at a large conference in Oakland,

536
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.240
a core of women called

537
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.310
for the Black Panther Party's official recognition

538
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.980
that increasing numbers of women were experiencing

539
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.210
the same law enforcement harassment as men.

540
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.380
They also argued that they were beginning to see themselves

541
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.150
in the same critical roles as women

542
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.260
in armed revolts on other continents,

543
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.920
such as Central America and Africa.

544
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.640
Yet those who would become mothers also had

545
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.680
to face another reality, minimal structural support

546
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.850
beneath the veneer of revolutionary ideology.

547
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.400
Even before numerous women became mothers,

548
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.826
they had to deal with the reality

549
00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:48.440
that Black Panther Party revolutionary ideas

550
00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.676
and practices were biologically alienating for them.

551
00:29:52.676 --> 00:29:56.630
The Black Panther Party took pride in the fact

552
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.075
that the women were trained

553
00:29:58.075 --> 00:30:01.067
using the exact same military approach

554
00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:03.630
of drills, for example.

555
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.300
Women learned to assemble, shoot,

556
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.620
disassemble and clean weapons.

557
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.630
They performed combat maneuvers,

558
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.313
sandbagged homes and led drill sections themselves.

559
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.330
Even in interviews that I conducted

560
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.110
with about 30 or 40 women,

561
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.710
they also took pride in remembering all

562
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.473
of those things that they had done.

563
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.820
Simultaneously, however, the stress

564
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.150
and intensity associated with these activities

565
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.510
and the outside pressures of constant federal

566
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:37.490
and local law enforcement surveillance led

567
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.330
to numerous miscarriages

568
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.990
and other reproductive health problems.

569
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.880
Of course, this is the kind of information

570
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.030
that you won't find

571
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.350
in the newspapers in the Panther newspaper or in the books.

572
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.428
Instead, this information was revealed to me

573
00:30:51.428 --> 00:30:54.430
during personal interviews that I had done.

574
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.870
And I really believe that they only shared that information

575
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.103
with me because I was a woman, a young woman.

576
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.010
The transition to planned parenthood was directly connected

577
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.150
to the realization that changes had to be made

578
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.101
if the party held its future,

579
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.790
held its future's best interest at heart.

580
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.170
Yet this change only seemed possible

581
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.640
once large numbers of individuals were relocated

582
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.530
to the national headquarters in Oakland.

583
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:28.630
During the years between 1972 and 1977,

584
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.310
the Black Panther Party was involved

585
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.940
in expanding its base in Oakland.

586
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.520
They expanded their services

587
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.110
from free breakfast for school children

588
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.010
and other afterschool and summer programs for children

589
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.550
to include services for senior citizens, teens

590
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.860
and other non-educational programs

591
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.540
for the wider Oakland community.

592
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.900
In the midst of these changes,

593
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.890
the predominantly female program coordinators

594
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.170
were also engaged

595
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.180
in restructuring the internal organizational structure

596
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.330
to accommodate the entire Black Panther Party workforce.

597
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.580
Huey Newton and other supporting party leadership

598
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.450
redirected the organization's energies

599
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.453
towards establishing a firm base within the local community.

600
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.520
To this end, Audrea Jones proposed

601
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.500
and instituted a planned parenthood policy

602
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.280
to compliment the structural changes,

603
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280
such as the 1970 creation of a childcare facility in Oakland

604
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.270
for Black Panther Party members' children.

605
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.690
Jones was one of the most dynamic

606
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.740
and respected local leaders who had been transferred

607
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.940
to Oakland from the Boston, Massachusetts chapter

608
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.130
where she had begun one

609
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:47.130
of several successful national Black Panther sponsored

610
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.170
free community health clinics.

611
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.800
Her specialty was in healthcare,

612
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.660
the division within which she worked

613
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.790
when she moved to Oakland.

614
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.350
During August 1972, Jones proposed

615
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:03.300
that the party implement a planned parenthood policy.

616
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.490
The impact of financial centralization became central

617
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.020
to the experiences of those wishing to have children.

618
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.593
Beginning July 1972,

619
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.220
the Central Committee and party members had dialogued

620
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.193
about a birth control policy.

621
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.850
Audrea Jones, an integral part of the party as staff

622
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.410
at the Oakland-based George Jackson Free Health Clinic

623
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.270
was author of a powerful document noting the need

624
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:34.210
for a shifting policy regarding birth control

625
00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.420
and family planning.

626
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.760
Jones' ideological position is important

627
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.920
because it shows a marked shift

628
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.130
from the 1968 and '69 argument

629
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.460
that women should bear children for the revolution

630
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.743
and reject birth control because it was genocidal.

631
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.200
The document refers to the increase in births

632
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.800
within the party, in terms of the financial

633
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.403
and manpower strain it would place on the organization.

634
00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:02.557
"Our experience has been one of groups

635
00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:04.057
"of sisters becoming pregnant

636
00:34:04.057 --> 00:34:07.967
"at approximately the same time," Jones begins.

637
00:34:07.967 --> 00:34:10.737
"As a result, we have had bulk increases

638
00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:12.607
"in financial expenses

639
00:34:12.607 --> 00:34:15.766
"and bulk decreases in manpower during the pregnancies,

640
00:34:15.766 --> 00:34:19.697
"and the childcare staffs are experiencing similar problems

641
00:34:19.697 --> 00:34:21.387
"after the babies are born."

642
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.950
Not only did the children need financial assistance

643
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:26.250
for food and clothing

644
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.980
as well as shelter and healthcare provided by the party,

645
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.930
but more specifically, manpower was lost

646
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.843
for the survival programs and community outreach.

647
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.270
Essentially, while the mothers were pregnant,

648
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.767
they were not always able to remain active in the community,

649
00:34:42.767 --> 00:34:46.550
a requirement for all Black Panther Party members.

650
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.300
This is evident in the Health Cadre Reports

651
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.120
for the period June 1972 through March 1973.

652
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.570
Under the section headings Cadre and Community

653
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.070
in these weekly reports, there was usually a reference

654
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.170
to the morale of the members

655
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.660
linked to whether they had the opportunity to work

656
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.160
outside the clinic conducting voter registration,

657
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.990
for instance, during the 1972-73 Bobby Seale

658
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.153
and Elaine Brown campaigns.

659
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.260
Indeed, there was a direct correlation

660
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.700
between high spirits and community involvement.

661
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.170
The converse was true regarding low morale

662
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.803
and low community involvement.

663
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.860
Most interesting was Jones' suggestion

664
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.310
that the Black Panther Party and the spirit

665
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.610
of true social equality not forced the woman

666
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.410
to bear the responsibility of birth control alone.

667
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.660
In Jones' opinion,

668
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.667
this was quote, "backward and unprogressive."

669
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.470
Yet she admitted that idea was present in the party.

670
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.850
In an attempt to alleviate these ideas,

671
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.610
Joan suggested that both women and men attend

672
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.907
Black Panther Party clinic-sponsored birth control classes.

673
00:35:57.907 --> 00:36:01.360
These classes would not only consist of the pros and cons

674
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.300
of various birth control devices and methods

675
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.920
but also and more importantly,

676
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.273
the responsibility and necessity for us to do so.

677
00:36:11.517 --> 00:36:16.517
Jones's issues were placed on the August 16th, 1972 agenda

678
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.237
of the Central Committee meeting and included quote,

679
00:36:20.237 --> 00:36:23.357
"setting a policy of planned parenthood in the party,

680
00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:26.337
"the establishment of a policy for expectant mothers

681
00:36:26.337 --> 00:36:27.827
"and a designated period

682
00:36:27.827 --> 00:36:30.187
"of recuperation after childbirth."

683
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.160
The party had established its goals for the upcoming years

684
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.340
and it was a practical, organizational necessity

685
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.310
to make decisions

686
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.752
that would keep Black Panther Party women healthy

687
00:36:40.752 --> 00:36:43.300
and the party more efficient

688
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.140
in terms of manpower and finances.

689
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.870
Between April and July, there were five new babies.

690
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.680
And by December, there would be three more,

691
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.630
in addition to the 21 already at the childcare center,

692
00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.030
the preschool component of the childcare center,

693
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.030
and 48 at the alternative elementary school they developed,

694
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.530
then known as the Intercommunal Youth Institute

695
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.550
but that would later go on

696
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.650
to be called the Oakland Community School.

697
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.440
This was a financial reality

698
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.280
for the financially strapped party.

699
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.380
The additional issue to be discussed

700
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.380
on the agenda was the relationship between party members

701
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.290
and the outside community regarding dating,

702
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.663
sexuality and reproduction.

703
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.570
Jones suggested that outside dating policy be clarified

704
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.950
and that party members not be allowed to reproduce children

705
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.390
with non-party members.

706
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.350
For Jones, ideological training was necessary

707
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.060
for members to understand

708
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.220
the full responsibilities of parenthood.

709
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.310
Therefore, she suggested that planned parenthood be a part

710
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:52.120
of the political education discussions.

711
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.100
Furthermore, Jones believed the party would benefit

712
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.140
from collective decision-making regarding having children,

713
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.180
especially since the membership was young

714
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.823
in age and ideologically.

715
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.750
In essence, she proposed a four-step process.

716
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.270
One, a comrade sister and brother should first decide

717
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.590
between themselves that they wished to have a child.

718
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.840
This is usually not the case.

719
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.940
Many of the pregnancies in our party are not planned.

720
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.960
Two, discussions between them and the review committee,

721
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.690
which would consist of responsible members

722
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.060
and should include finance secretary, personnel

723
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.683
and the ministry of health.

724
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.600 line:15% 
Number three, based upon the discussions

725
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.350 line:15% 
and the objective conditions,

726
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.930 line:15% 
the review committee would then make recommendations

727
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.406 line:15% 
to the entire Central Committee,

728
00:38:43.406 --> 00:38:47.380
the Central Committee being the body of,

729
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.640
the select body of members that made,

730
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.203
that determined policy for the whole organization.

731
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.360
And number four,

732
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.710
the Central Committee would then make a decision

733
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.928
as to the feasibility at that time.

734
00:38:59.928 --> 00:39:02.296
These were all suggestions,

735
00:39:02.296 --> 00:39:04.300
party women were never forced

736
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.960
not to have children.

737
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.910
Indeed, there's evidence that women made their own decisions

738
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.760
about whether they would have children

739
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.223
by practicing some form of birth control.

740
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.780
By January '74, however,

741
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.190
Black Panther Party members were told

742
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.160
in a directive from Huey P. Newton

743
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.167
that all members should practice quote,

744
00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:26.167
"some form of birth control."

745
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.170
While this might have seemed the practical

746
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.320
and logical decision to make,

747
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.710
numerous women were battling

748
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.820
with their personal desires while simultaneously laboring

749
00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.360
for the collective.

750
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.980
It was difficult for them to give up all the things

751
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.800
they had been socialized to expect.

752
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.360
Katherine Campbell, a member

753
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.870
of the San Francisco branch left the party

754
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.660
on several occasions in an attempt to spend more time

755
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.050
with her husband, who she had met in the party and daughter.

756
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.590
Her husband had left the party, but she would return

757
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.690
because of her commitment

758
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.350
to the party's community service goals,

759
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.640
her commitment to the Oakland Community School

760
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.373
and her deep regard for the party as a surrogate family.

761
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.240
Like a woman in 1974, who had decided to return to Detroit

762
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.650
and have her baby instead of remaining in the party,

763
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.790
Campbell had spent many years of her life

764
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.640
searching for what family meant to her.

765
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.290
And at this stage, she believed

766
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.650
that she could find a more personal meaning

767
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.929
by leaving the party to focus on nuclear family living

768
00:40:27.929 --> 00:40:32.110
instead of the Black Panther Party's collective lifestyle.

769
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.030
When JoNina Abron arrived

770
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.660
at party headquarters in Oakland in February

771
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.910
or March of 1974, there was a Central Committee directive

772
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.560
ordering members to practice birth control.

773
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.160
This was in sharp contrast to the attitude

774
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.930
of party leadership and many male

775
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.910
and female rank and file members,

776
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:55.250
who in '69 and '70 discouraged any serious discussion

777
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.450
of birth control

778
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.030
and called for the reproduction of the young warriors

779
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.630
for the revolution.

780
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.390
No longer apparently was there the immediate possibility

781
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.900
of an impending revolution

782
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.593
for which children and young adults would be needed.

783
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.000
All women, however, did not subscribe to the early policies.

784
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.830
Elaine Brown in a 1976 interview revealed

785
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.970
that she had always made the final decision

786
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.987
for her personal life.

787
00:41:21.987 --> 00:41:24.187
"I never went along with that program.

788
00:41:24.187 --> 00:41:27.300
"I always bought my own contraceptives."

789
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.730
Regarding the new attitude after 1974,

790
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.358
Brown recalls that quote, "Having or not having a child

791
00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:37.557
"or having or not having an abortion was left

792
00:41:37.557 --> 00:41:39.397
"as an individual decision."

793
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.790
JoNina Abron refers to another example

794
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.640
of a woman making her own decision

795
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.383
about reproduction rights.

796
00:41:47.317 --> 00:41:49.900
Abron personally knew the woman member

797
00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.300
from Detroit who had become pregnant

798
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.860
at the time that the directive was being circulated

799
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.200
among members of the Oakland branch.

800
00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.430
Rather than abort her unborn child,

801
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.410
which was a suggestion that was made to the woman,

802
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.460
the unnamed woman decided that she would return to Detroit

803
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.563
to have her baby.

804
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.810
Deborah Johnson left the chapter,

805
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.530
because she could not simultaneously raise her child

806
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.560
and continue to work in the party full time.

807
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.030
And according to her: Before you were by yourself.

808
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.580
You could really sleep anywhere

809
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.190
and you could work all night,

810
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.270
but when you have the responsibility of children,

811
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:26.780
you can't do that.

812
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.610
There was no structure set up to work

813
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.880
within the party to continue to work

814
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.270
in the breakfast program, to continue to sell the newspaper.

815
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.370
It was the demand to do it all or nothing.

816
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.030
You would have to explain why you had

817
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.080
to go take your child to the doctor,

818
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.830
go through some struggle with that.

819
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.767
Therefore, after continuing her work,

820
00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:50.391
she left the party because she,

821
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:53.930
again, did not want her mother to take full responsibility

822
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.623
for caring for that child.

823
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.760
Not only were there problems for those Panther members,

824
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.480
especially women who were in need of childcare facilities,

825
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.400
there were also reproductive problems for the women

826
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.810
as mentioned earlier.

827
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.720
And women throughout the country

828
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.463
in the various chapters experienced that same form

829
00:43:14.463 --> 00:43:17.453
of intense pressure and physical rigor.

830
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:23.090
Although between 1970 and '73, there were childcare houses

831
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.830
or centers where both men and women worked,

832
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.810
it was not until 1973

833
00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.030
that Newton established a school in Oakland

834
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.860
for the Panther children and dormitories for the children.

835
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.540
According to Elaine Brown,

836
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.660
while most party members worked every day

837
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.600
at their varying tasks,

838
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.410
some were assigned to care for and teach our children.

839
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.270
That was an expression of a party ideal,

840
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.900
that the family was the collective.

841
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.700
Nothing belongs to the individual,

842
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.700
neither money, nor housing, nor men, women, children.

843
00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.794
Everything was part of the whole, the collective.

844
00:44:01.794 --> 00:44:04.410
Therefore individuals now had a structure

845
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.893
within which to incorporate their family.

846
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.510
However, not all women felt a sense of community

847
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.560
and family within the BPP structure.

848
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.465
As late as August 1977, Black Panther Party women

849
00:44:18.465 --> 00:44:20.530
were involved in discussions

850
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.820
and reflections regarding their relationship

851
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.770
to party men and non-party men.

852
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.120
By this point, the number

853
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.210
of Black Panther chapters had dwindled

854
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.160
to approximately four

855
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.400
and the total membership was less than 200.

856
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.880
Additionally, at least 33% of those involved were close to

857
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.380
or had already entered their 30s in age.

858
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.770
The membership was asked to respond to the issue

859
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.340
of whether or not Panther women should be allowed

860
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.670
to date men outside the party.

861
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.640
Overwhelmingly, those who responded believed

862
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.810
that women should be allowed

863
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.660
to date men outside the party

864
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.450
if these men were organizational supporters

865
00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.750
and if they did not represent a threat of any kind

866
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:06.395
to the woman's continued involvement with the party.

867
00:45:06.395 --> 00:45:08.660
This concern about not allowing women

868
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.359
to date men outside the party hearkened back

869
00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:14.140
to those earliest days when Bobby Seale

870
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:18.101
and Eldridge Cleaver had linked a woman's drawing power

871
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:23.101
and physical appearance to their roles in the organization.

872
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.730
Unfortunately, almost 10 years later, after both Seale

873
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.600
and Cleaver had been expelled, the maintenance

874
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.420
of this dating policy was continuing to generate tensions

875
00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.880
for some BPP membership.

876
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.843
The policy suggests that even after such a long time

877
00:45:40.843 --> 00:45:44.140
women were not trusted to be able to think for themselves

878
00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.060
and resist being drawn away from their party work.

879
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.860
Letters from the men on the question

880
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.190
of outside dating were basic notes

881
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.890
of support that they agreed

882
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.990
that women should be allowed the same privilege

883
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.520
of seeking outside companionship.

884
00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.780
On the other hand,

885
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.600
the women were more analytical and expressive

886
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.590
and tapped into the emotional impact of their isolation.

887
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.700
One member who felt

888
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:12.100
she had had too many negative interactions with male members

889
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.191
who only wanted to have sex with her and nothing more

890
00:46:15.191 --> 00:46:19.100
spoke of her regular consideration of lesbianism

891
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.550
because of her need to simply feel loved

892
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.793
and be treated nicely by someone.

893
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:29.810
She also spoke of community members seeing her, should I?

894
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.103
Okay.

895
00:46:31.103 --> 00:46:33.810
She also spoke of community members seeing her

896
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:38.810
as nothing more than an automaton, an asexual workaholic.

897
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.390
One letter to Newton from the newspaper's editor

898
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.390
reflected the feelings of many women's correspondence.

899
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.830
And so for that reason,

900
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:49.672
I'd like to quote extensively from this.

901
00:46:49.672 --> 00:46:50.640
And JoNina Abron,

902
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.352
the woman from the Detroit chapter

903
00:46:52.352 --> 00:46:55.923
who moved to Oakland in 1974 is the author of this.

904
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.730
Throughout the 29 years of my life,

905
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.930
I have experienced the dual pain

906
00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.400
of being a Black woman in America.

907
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.700
When I joined the party five years ago, I was thrilled

908
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.300
about becoming part of an organization that believes

909
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.790
in the equality of men and women.

910
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.130
However, I have since learned that my comrades

911
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:19.490
and I have yet to overcome many of our backward ideas.

912
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.500
I believe there are some women in the party

913
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.950
who have the political strength

914
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.240
to maintain principled relationships

915
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.180
with men who do not belong to the party,

916
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.380
men, who although they may not necessarily

917
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.670
be potential party members are making a contribution

918
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.230
to the community.

919
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.310
Obviously just as the comrade brothers

920
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.099
in the party may find themselves sexually attracted

921
00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:42.870
to women who are not in the party,

922
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.320
so do we women encounter men

923
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.830
in the community who attract us.

924
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.160
I do not deny that this is a chauvinist society.

925
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.022
Because I am an aggressive person,

926
00:47:53.022 --> 00:47:56.520
I have suffered from male chauvinism all my life,

927
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.110
perhaps more so than less aggressive women

928
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.030
who nevertheless suffer just as I have and do.

929
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:06.340
I feel that both men and women party members

930
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.490
who elect to have sexual relationships

931
00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:12.910
outside our party should do so with people who have ideals

932
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.010
and goals common to ours.

933
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:16.030
If they do not,

934
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:19.270
then the relationship is not only nonproductive.

935
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.650
It may, in the case of the comrade sister,

936
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.930
draw her away from the party

937
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.652
if she lacks political strength.

938
00:48:26.652 --> 00:48:30.460
In the interests of the party, I believe that a body

939
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.300
of comrades should be designated to provide direction to men

940
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.780
and women party members who choose

941
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.260
to have relationships outside the party.

942
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.670
This way we maintain structure

943
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.820
as we do in all areas of our party.

944
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.250
My concern about male-female relationships

945
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.760
extends beyond the sexual aspect.

946
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.750
Ultimately, it will take a new

947
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.500
and humane society to alter the ways in which men

948
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.470
and women in America treat each other.

949
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.490
Within our party, it bothers me that there are a couple

950
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:05.640
of comrade brothers who still view women as sexual objects.

951
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.760
We should have no men

952
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.290
in the Black Panther Party who feel this way

953
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.170
or women for that matter.

954
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.650
It bothers me that there are a few brothers

955
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.493
who seem unable to carry a conversation with me

956
00:49:16.493 --> 00:49:18.860
once I explain that I am not interested

957
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.750
in going to bed with them.

958
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.790
It makes me feel that,

959
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.550
it makes me feel that they feel I have no value

960
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:26.683
behind my body.

961
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.170
I realize that I made a ridiculous statement above,

962
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.240
when I said that my concern extends beyond the sexual aspect

963
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.220
of male-female relationships.

964
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.294
It is because of backwards ideas about the role

965
00:49:39.294 --> 00:49:43.730
of men and the role of women that this whole problem exists.

966
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.030
I would like to see the party seriously begin

967
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.180
to deal with this issue.

968
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.510
While we have a number of women

969
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.660
in leadership positions in our party,

970
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.240
they are respected by the men

971
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.420
because they are in leadership.

972
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.990
I have seen time after time instances in which brothers,

973
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.683
not in the leadership, promptly carry out suggestions

974
00:50:02.683 --> 00:50:05.660
made by women central body members

975
00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.360
and ignore and often insult women

976
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.020
not on the central body who made the same suggestion.

977
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.560
This appalls me.

978
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.240
I do not hesitate to admit

979
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.890
that women are guilty of the same type of attitude

980
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:22.040
toward men who are not in the leadership.

981
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.710
The bottom line is that chauvinism exists in our party

982
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.760
to the extent that it does,

983
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.873
because we women tolerate it.

984
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.010
I'd actually like to leave you

985
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.990
with that chunk of quote from JoNina Abron,

986
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.470
and at this point not give you my opinion on it,

987
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:47.000
because I'd actually like to get some feedback

988
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.600
from you afterwards.

989
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.200
But essentially to close,

990
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.720
I think that as Black Panther Party women matured,

991
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.800
they had the presence of mind to understand

992
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.780
that a lot of the dilemmas that they faced were

993
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.780
in some instances linked to their position

994
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.910
in the party because they were a member.

995
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.990
But I think they also began to realize

996
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.620
that there were certain issues

997
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.000
that were separate and distinct from the things

998
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.823
that Black Panther Party men had to deal with.

999
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.320
Being female and being a mother placed them in a category

1000
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.770
that was unique.

1001
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.340
They neither used these distinctions as crutches

1002
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.053
nor as the opportunity to practice one-upsmanship.

1003
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.525 line:15% 
Instead, select female organizational planners made sure

1004
00:51:36.525 --> 00:51:39.900 line:15% 
that the party addressed the needs of its women

1005
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.970 line:15% 
and children to the necessary degree

1006
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.443 line:15% 
to keep the group functionally efficient.

1007
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.310
There's so much more that I could say about the topic,

1008
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:53.250
but today my intention was just to provide some information

1009
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.970
that could serve as food for thought,

1010
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.070
particularly for the individuals,

1011
00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:01.350
women and men who are involved in organizations

1012
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.995
that force you to make decisions

1013
00:52:02.995 --> 00:52:07.800
for the common good but that have an impact on the lives

1014
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.110
of a greater proportion of one group of members

1015
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:13.053
than the other.

1016
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.410
Black Panther Party women's history also reveals

1017
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:22.120
that at the times when one's needs are not being met,

1018
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.123
tough decisions have to be made.

1019
00:52:25.186 --> 00:52:29.390
In numerous cases, women who did not feel structurally

1020
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.630
or emotionally supported left the group.

1021
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.930
Others remained and fought within the structure

1022
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.463
until their needs were met.

1023
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.590
I think the most important thing to remember is,

1024
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.950
Ericka Huggins said in the clip from the video is

1025
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:47.210
that all these Black Panther Party members were human

1026
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.930
whether they were male or female,

1027
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:54.150
and the choices that they made were intensely as personal

1028
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.830
as they were, excuse me, as they were public.

1029
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.440
And I think the one thing that's clear is

1030
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.044
that there's really no easy way to disassociate

1031
00:53:04.044 --> 00:53:05.900
the private from the public

1032
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.060
and the personal from the political.

1033
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.630
So I'd like to thank you

1034
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.190
for your time and attention

1035
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:14.209
and also open up for questions.

1036
00:53:14.209 --> 00:53:17.209
(audience applauds)

1037
00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:31.220
During the earliest years,

1038
00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.913
the babies for the revolution phase,

1039
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.080
that's also the period when

1040
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.050
because of all the outside law enforcement pressure,

1041
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:44.910
there were lots of purges that were going on internally.

1042
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.910
And a lot of men were expelled from the party,

1043
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:55.460
because they were considered to be, you know,

1044
00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:58.080
agent provocateurs causing dissension.

1045
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.410
And it was revealed in later testimony

1046
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.208
that some of them were actually undercover policemen.

1047
00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:08.732
But a number of women were expelled

1048
00:54:08.732 --> 00:54:12.950
for the same reason that they were praised,

1049
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.060
they were lauded and praised,

1050
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.370
because they could attract men to the party,

1051
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:17.547
make babies for the revolution.

1052
00:54:17.547 --> 00:54:21.310
And that became a tool that was used against them,

1053
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:24.320
because the argument would be that, oh, you can tell

1054
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.680
that this person, this woman is an agent provocateur

1055
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.930
because since she's joined the party

1056
00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:31.510
all she's wanting to do is sleep with this leader

1057
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.133
and that leader and the next person.

1058
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.600
But I would have to say that during the earliest years,

1059
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.140
the decisions to leave were very personal

1060
00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.410
in terms of childcare and wondering how they would care

1061
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.660
for the children once the children were born.

1062
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.190
During the later years, there were still a lot

1063
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.593
of intraorganizational dissension going on,

1064
00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:04.150
particularly in 1977, when Huey Newton returned from Cuba,

1065
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.810
he had been in Cuban exile from 1974 to '77

1066
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:13.528
related to charges that he had pistol-whipped his tailor

1067
00:55:13.528 --> 00:55:15.780
and also that he had murdered,

1068
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.560
he had shot and murdered a 14-year-old prostitute

1069
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.740
in Oakland.

1070
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.350
So when he returned,

1071
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:26.320
according to Elaine Brown's autobiography

1072
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.963
and some other interviews that I had done,

1073
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:35.110
apparently a group of men who were considered the squad

1074
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.440
or the brothers, sort of the strong-armers

1075
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.260
in the party that supported Newton felt

1076
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.410
that they finally had the opportunity to get rid

1077
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.380
of all of these women who had been placed

1078
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.802
in these leadership positions

1079
00:55:50.802 --> 00:55:55.802
when Elaine Brown took over in '74 after Huey Newton left.

1080
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.470
And there are several reported cases of women being beaten

1081
00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:08.627
and raped actually and deciding to leave.

1082
00:56:09.612 --> 00:56:12.880
So that's not so much that,

1083
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.340
I mean, to answer your question,

1084
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.270
it's not so much that these beatings and such had

1085
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:22.880
and these expulsions had a direct impact

1086
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.280
on whether they could or couldn't have a child,

1087
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.140
but rather it's sort of the larger context, right?

1088
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:34.520
And especially with instances of rape, you know,

1089
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.540
and I'm saying this, I don't mean to say

1090
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.700
that every day there was a rape,

1091
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.427
but even if there was one rape, you know,

1092
00:56:41.427 --> 00:56:45.370
that calls to question the nature of this organization

1093
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:47.530
that's supposed to, you know,

1094
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.223
practice equality between men and women.

1095
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.400
Initially I think the assumption might be

1096
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.490
that there was no relationship between the two,

1097
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:12.376
but on the contrary, there was a large interaction

1098
00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:17.050
between the two groups, but especially here in the Bay Area.

1099
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:22.050
And what I found is that a number

1100
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.763
of Black Panther Party women,

1101
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:28.450
for example JoNina Abron,

1102
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.050
who was a newspaper editor

1103
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:35.600
as well as a couple other members would attend events

1104
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.120
that were billed as feminist events.

1105
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.265
And they would, the Black Panther Party would advertise

1106
00:57:43.265 --> 00:57:45.210
these upcoming events.

1107
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.940
And they would also include stories,

1108
00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:52.360
follow-up stories on the events in their newspaper.

1109
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.270
One thing that comes to mind also is a lot

1110
00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.040
of organizing that happened around political prisoners

1111
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.010
during the time,

1112
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.404
and Ericka Huggins, the same woman on the video

1113
00:58:03.404 --> 00:58:07.110
was in prison in New Haven

1114
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:11.417
between 1969 and 1971 charged for the murder

1115
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:18.360
of one Black Panther Party member in the New Haven chapter.

1116
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:23.360
And the National Welfare Rights Organization

1117
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
as well as a number of grassroots feminist organizations

1118
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:37.050
staunchly supported Ericka Huggins' case,

1119
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.130
not because she was a Black Panther

1120
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.090
but because she was a woman.

1121
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.650
And she was arrested at the same time

1122
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.170
with about eight other women,

1123
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:50.120
I think about eight other women from the New Haven chapter,

1124
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.200
a couple of whom had been pregnant when they were arrested.

1125
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.840
So they had delivered the babies in prison,

1126
00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.010
and they had their babies removed from them.

1127
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.780
So around the issue of motherhood

1128
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.790
and incarceration is where they found that point

1129
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:06.760
of entry to agree.

1130
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.313
And actually one group,

1131
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.960
I can't remember the name of it right now,

1132
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.960
but they almost refused to join that particular movement

1133
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:22.840
because in their mind the Black Panther Party was filled

1134
00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.780
with a bunch of egotistical macho individuals.

1135
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.960
And they assumed that if they became involved

1136
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.810
in this arm

1137
00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:37.300
of Black Panther Party's organizing

1138
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.720
that the Black Panther Party would try

1139
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.290
to take over their organization.

1140
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:44.840
So there are also examples

1141
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.530
of women who joined the Black Panther Party

1142
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.850
in the search for their identity.

1143
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:53.360
And after having about a year or so experience

1144
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.210
with the Panthers and keeping their eyes

1145
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.530
and ears open to the larger feminist movement

1146
00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.290
decided that they would prefer to be

1147
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.502
in the feminist movement than in the Black Panther Party.

1148
01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.250
So there's a wide perspective,

1149
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.010
but they definitely had interactions.

1150
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:12.810
I think one thing that's really interesting is

1151
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.900
when I interviewed a lot of these women

1152
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.870
and I asked them

1153
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.230
if they considered themselves feminists at the time,

1154
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.600
they were almost offended

1155
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:28.510
that I would even imply such a thing, because it's,

1156
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.770
I think you remember from JoNina Abron's quote.

1157
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:35.047
She said, you know, "I'm a Black woman,

1158
01:00:35.047 --> 01:00:38.187
"and I consider myself a Panther member

1159
01:00:38.187 --> 01:00:40.180
"before I consider myself a woman."

1160
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.583
So there was always that tension.

1161
01:00:53.705 --> 01:00:58.340
Yes, about 90%

1162
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.380
of them are still involved

1163
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.120
in community organizing and community activism

1164
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.618
in some shape or form, might be even higher than that.

1165
01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:11.753
The common theme that drew them

1166
01:01:11.753 --> 01:01:16.540
to the organization in 1968 in large numbers,

1167
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.151
because they joined as early as 1967,

1168
01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:23.440
but they rallied to the organization in 1968

1169
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.860
because of the increased community work

1170
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.780
that was being done.

1171
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.270
After the organization had moved

1172
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:36.160
beyond the armed police patrols of the communities,

1173
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.360
which a couple of women had been involved in,

1174
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.540
that's when the women really became involved.

1175
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.313
And to link my response to your question

1176
01:01:44.313 --> 01:01:48.140
with what Vera had asked me about violence,

1177
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.330
intraorganizational violence,

1178
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:55.330
a lot of women endured years of that kind of abuse,

1179
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.720
because they were committed to the goals

1180
01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.650
of the Oakland Community School, more specifically,

1181
01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:08.723
and the education that the children received.

1182
01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:12.306
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1183
01:02:12.306 --> 01:02:17.306
Thank you.
