project_style:

  # Defines how content metadata is generated.
  content_structure: 'simple_image'  # Basic content metadata. Every file in the digital
                                     # object will appear as a <file> node in <contentMetadata
									 # with resource type="image"

                     'simple_book'   # Like simple_image, but with <contentMetadata
                                     # type="book"> and <resource type="page">.

                     'smpl'          # Content metadata is generated by converting a
                                     # pre-content metadata file supplied by SMPL.

  # Whether the pre-assembly process should register the objects.
  should_register: true   # Use if the objects are not yet registered
                   false  # Use if the objects are already registered.

  # Pre-assembly must obtain a druid for every object.
  get_druid_from: 'suri'               # Only used with should_register = true.

                  'container'          # Object is contained in a druid subdirectory
                                       # For example: "aa111bb2222".

                  'container_barcode'  # Object is contained in a barcode subdirectory.
                                       # For example: "36105115575834".

  # Whether to mint mock druids (relevant only for developers).
  use_druid_minter: false   # Use this setting for most uses.
                    true    # Mints a mock druid rather than using Suri.
                            # Overrides get_druid_from = 'suri'.


####
# Paths to the pre-assembly input and output.
####

bundle_dir:  '/foo/bar/revs'  # Input location for the project content (i.e., the 
                             # "bundle"). May contain images directly or may contain 
                             # folders, one per object, usually named by druid. 
							 # A fully qualified path.

staging_dir: '/dor/assembly' # Where to put the pre-assembled materials. This is
                             # where the assembly robots expect to find the assembled
                             # content. The value is rarely changed, expect by 
                             # developers in special circumstances.
							 # A fully qualified path.

####
# Specif how pre-assembly should locate objects within the bundle_dir.
# Here we are discovering the object containers. An object container
# is either a single file or a single directory.
####

object_discovery:

  # Option 1: use a manifest.
  use_manifest: true    # If true, set glob and regex to nil.
                false   # If false, set glob and regex paramaters to match your sub-directories

  # Option 2: two-phase directory crawl.
  #
  #   - A glob pattern is used to find the object containers within the 'bundle_dir' set above.
  #     This pattern is passed to Ruby's Dir.glob(). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Dir.html#method-c-glob
  #
  #   - Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Both the glob and regex should be expressed in relative terms --
  # in other words, they do not include the bundle_dir.
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  '*'                                    # Everything.
         '*.tif'                                # Only .tif files.

  regex: ~                                      # No filtering.
         '^[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d\d$' # Only druid directories.
         '^\d+$'                                # Only barcode directories.
  
  
####
# Once object containers have been identified, specify which files within those
# containers should be staged (i.e., copied to the staging_dir).
####

stageable_discovery:

  # Option 1: use the object container itself.  This will simply stage the entire object directory that was matched with the glob above.
  use_container: true    # If true, set glob and regex to nil.
                 false   # If false, use glob and regex below.

  # Option 2: a two-phase container crawl.
  #
  # The glob parameter can be used to flatten or partially flatten the input
  # directory structure. For example, consider this input structure:
  #
  #   aa111bb2222/
  #     00/
  #       1.tif
  #       2.tif
  #     01/
  #       1.jp2
  #       2.jp2
  #
  # If glob = '*', both the 00 and 01 subdirectories will be staged in
  # their entirely, preserving the original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00', only the 00 subdirectory will be staged, preserving
  # its original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00/*', only the files within 00 will be staged, which means
  # that the 00 subdirectory will not appear in the staged materials, as
  # shown here:
  #
  #    aa/111/bb/2222/
  #      1.tif
  #      2.tif
  #
  # As above, express the glob and regex in relative terms -- in 
  # this case, relative to the container.
  #
  #  Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  '0[12]/'  # Stage the 00, 01, and 02 subdirectories.
         '00/*'    # Stage the items in the 00 subdirectory only, but not the '00' folder itself.
         '*/*'     # Stage the items residing at the second level in the structure.
         '**/*'    # Stage all leaf items. Results it total flattening. Use with caution since it may cause file name clashes.

  regex:  ~                       # No filtering.
         '(?ix) \. (tif|xml) $'  # Stage only items with .tif and .xml extentions.

# Additional materials accompaning the bundle.

desc_md_template: 'mods_template.xml'  # An optional descriptive metadata XML template to use in conjunction with the manifest.


####
# Bundles using a manifest must indicate the column names
# of certain fields in the CSV file.
#
# Bundles not using a manifest should set these values to nil.

manifest_cols:

####
# General project information.
####

project_name:      'Foo'                   # Required.  If objects are not yet registered, this will be used as a prefix to the sourceID and will also become a project tag in DOR for each object..

progress_log_file: '/log/progress_foo.yaml' # Required. Typically based on project name.  A fully qualified path.

apo_druid_id:      'druid:aa111bb2222'     # Required if pre-assembly is registering 
                                           # the objects.  Include druid prefix.

set_druid_id:      'druid:yy888xx9999'     # If supplied, pre-assembly will associate
                                           # the object with a set in Dor. Include druid prefix.
										   # Note that if you need to attach specific objects in your bundle
										   # into different sets, you will need to run pre-assembly twice with two different YAML files.
