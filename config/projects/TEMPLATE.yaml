####
# Specify how pre-assembly should locate objects within the bundle_dir.
# Here we are discovering the object containers. An object container
# is either a single file or a single directory.
####

object_discovery:

  # Option 1: use a manifest.
  use_manifest: true    # If true, set glob and regex to nil.
                false   # If false, set glob and regex paramaters to match your sub-directories

  # Option 2: two-phase directory crawl.
  #
  #   - A glob pattern is used to find the object containers within the 'bundle_dir' set above.
  #     This pattern is passed to Ruby's Dir.glob(). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Dir.html#method-c-glob
  #
  #   - Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Both the glob and regex should be expressed in relative terms --
  # in other words, they do not include the bundle_dir.
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  '*'                                    # Everything.
         '*.tif'                                # Only .tif files.

  regex: ~                                      # No filtering.
         '^[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d\d$' # Only druid directories.
         '^\d+$'                                # Only barcode directories.
  
  
####
# Once object containers have been identified, specify which files within those
# containers should be staged (i.e., copied to the staging_dir).
####

stageable_discovery:

  # Option 1: If you set 'use_container' to true, this will simply stage the entire object directory that was matched with the glob above.
  # This is not a valid option if your object is contained in a folder named by druid or barcode - preassembly will give an error message if you set 
  # 'use_container' to true and the 'get_druid_from' parameter to 'container' or 'container_barcode'.
   
  use_container: true    # If true , set glob and regex to nil below.
                 false   # If false, use glob and regex below.

  # Option 2: If you set 'use_container' to false, staging will be done via a two-phase container crawl based on the glob and regex patterns specified below.
  #
  # The glob parameter can be used to flatten or partially flatten the input
  # directory structure. For example, consider this input structure:
  #
  #   aa111bb2222/
  #     00/
  #       1.tif
  #       2.tif
  #     01/
  #       1.jp2
  #       2.jp2
  #
  # If glob = '*', both the 00 and 01 subdirectories will be staged in
  # their entirely, preserving the original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00', only the 00 subdirectory will be staged, preserving
  # its original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00/*', only the files within 00 will be staged, which means
  # that the 00 subdirectory will not appear in the staged materials, as
  # shown here:
  #
  #    aa/111/bb/2222/
  #      1.tif
  #      2.tif
  #
  # As above, express the glob and regex in relative terms -- in 
  # this case, relative to the container.
  #
  #  Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  '0[12]/'  # Stage the 00, 01, and 02 subdirectories.
         '00/*'    # Stage the items in the 00 subdirectory only, but not the '00' folder itself.
         '*/*'     # Stage the items residing at the second level in the structure.
         '**/*'    # Stage all leaf items. Results it total flattening. Use with caution since it may cause file name clashes.  Note-this will also stage all folders
                   #   as well, unless you further restrict to specific files only using the regex below.
         '*'       # Stage all items at the root level of the container (useful for a container that has no structure, just a list of files) 
         
  regex:  ~                       # No filtering.
         '(?ix) \. (tif|xml) $'  # Stage only items with .tif and .xml extentions.
  files_only:  true     # if set to true, then only files will be staged, regardless of glob specified above (i.e. any folders that match the glob will 
                        #  be ignored) -- this is useful to avoid duplication of staged files
                        #  if set to false or left off, then anything that matches the glob (and not filtered by regex) will be staged

accession_items:   ~         # Only valid for projects that do *not* use a manifest.

                            # You can supply a list of container names, and indicate if this list is exlcusionary
                            # or inclusionary.  In other words, do you want to *only* accession the named items, or accession
                            # everything *except* those listed? You can also specify if this is a re-accession, in which case the
                            # items will be reset (but not unregistered from DOR) before accessioning again.
                            # If you specify ~, all items will be accessioned and you can leave off the "only" and "except" parameters.
                            # Note that you will probably also want to log this new run using a different progress log file.  
                            # In the "only" and "except" list, you should use names that exactly match the folder names in your bundle_dir,
                            # one per line, indented under "only" or "except" and preceeded by a dash as shown in the examples below.
                            # If 'should_register: true', and you want to run a re-accession, then you should create a new manifest file (see the README)
                            # For a normal run (or if 'should_register: true'), set "accession_items" to ~, which will process all items.

    - 'bb222bb2222'             # this is an example of two objects that will be ignored, put them one per line, prefixed by a space, a dash, and space, add quotes around each item

# These options provides a means to use the dir_validator gem to validate
# the contents of the bundle directory. Supply the path to the Ruby code that will
# perform the validation (see spec/test_data/project_config_files/local_dev_rumsey.rb
# for an example). Also supply the path to the file to be used to report any
# validation warnings. If warnings are generated, pre-assembly won't run. 
# Use fully qualified paths from the root of the server, not relative to pre-assembly.
