# This action is used to remediate objects in some way that you define.
# You supply a list of druids to remediate in a CSV file and a Ruby file defining a method that operates on the objects.
# The code handles all logging and versioning as needed.

# Run with
# ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT=production bin/remediate INPUT_FILE.csv REMEDIATE_LOGIC_FILENAME.rb

# eg. ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT=production bin/remediate /dor/preassembly/remediation/revs_all_pids.csv /thumpers/dpgthumper-staging/Revs/revs_rights_remediate.rb

# INPUT_FILE can be either a pre-assembly generated YAML log file or a CSV file with one column containing at least a list of druids
# If a pre-assembly YAML log file is passed in, the successfully accessioned druids will be used.
# For a CSV file, there should be a header with a column labeled "druid" which indicates which column contains the druid
# This file should be in a location where the script has read/write access to it.

# e.g.
#druid,another_column
#druid:oo000oo0001,other stuff
#druid:oo000oo0002,ignored

# REMEDIATE_LOGIC_FILENAME is a reference to a Ruby code file that defines what you want the remediation to do.  An example of this 
# file is in lib/remediation/remediate_project_example.rb  Copy that file, and edit it somewhere the script can read it and then pass 
# the filename to the script.

# The result will be some screen output, a detailed .YML file in the same location and with the same name as the input CSV file.
# The input CSV file will be updated with two additional columns - a status indicating if remediation succeeded and a message.
# You can re-run remediation with the same CSV file and it will automatically skip already completed objects.

# Note that unless your laptop has access to the Fedora instance you need to remediate (usually Production), 
# you should probably run this from lyberservices-prod to have access to all mounts and configuration.
