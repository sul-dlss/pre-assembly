From https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form-bootstrap/blob/main/app/assets/stylesheets/simple_form-bootstrap/_form_legend_clear.scss
In bootstrap 5 legend floats left and requires the following element
to be cleared. In a radio button or checkbox group the element after
the legend will be the automatically generated hidden input; the fix
in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30345 applies to the hidden
input and has no visual effect. Here we try to fix matters by
applying the clear to the div wrapping the first following radio button
or checkbox.
