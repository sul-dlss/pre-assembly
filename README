Notes based on planning meeting:

    Maybe use Jove validation during common-assembly to compute checksums and
    image info (height, width, etc).

    Use Gould Book as a test case to guide the common-assembly development
    work.

    Ask Michael O. about idiosyncracies in the content.

    Implement this functionality in a way that will allow them to be used as
    services in the future.

Assembly gem

    This is a Ruby implementation of services needed to prepare objects to be
    accessioned in SULAIR digital library.  It contains classes to create

    objects, create content meta-data and perform other services needed for
    assembly


Run tests

    # Prerequisite.

    Kakadu Software Binaries - for JP2 generation

       Download and install demonstration binaries from Kakadu:
       http://www.kakadusoftware.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=22

       Note: The binaries will not work with RHEL 5.x; an RPM for RHEL 5 with

    Imagemagick 6.5 or higher
            
       RHEL 6: 

           # yum install ImageMagick

           The version of ImageMagick included with RHEL 6 has all of the
           dependency libraries included.
           
       RHEL 5: (RPM to install with included binaries comming soon)

           The version of ImageMagic included with RHEL 5 is too old and does
           not have all the proper binaries included/built

           Required libraries are:
           yum install lcms lcms-devel libtiff libtiff-devel libjpeg \
                       libjpeg-devel libpng libpng-devel

       Download latest version from:  http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool

           tar -xf Image-ExifTool-#.##.tar.gz
           cd Image-ExifTool-#.##
           perl Makefile.PL
